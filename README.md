NOTE: The dataset is publicly available for non-commercial use. Please refer to Chen, Xin, et al. "Symmetric Binary Tree Based Co-occurrence Texture Patterns Mining for Fine-grained Plant Leaf Image Retrieval." Pattern Recognition if you use this dataset in your publication.

## Details  
We collect 500 leaves of 100 peanut cultivars with 5 sample per cultivar to build a peanut leaf image dataset, named PeanCultivar100. All the peanut leaves are randomly collected from the upper part of different plants.  

Naming rules for leaf images of PeanCultivar100:  

Cultivar Index...... 

For example:  

For a leaf image named by “...”, its details are: the index of its cultivar is .......
